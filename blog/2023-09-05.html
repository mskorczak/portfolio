Lets just pretend that this could be the first article that I have ever written.

I want to use some extra parts here for flavour, but it seems unnesseary.\n

Especially since I am able to make the template look far better, perhaps even have a template within a template? That would get bad very quickly I feel. However, I definitely need to work out how to inject HTML directly into the templates, as opposed to just strings. Maybe there's a template option that i have not found just yet.

I've just tested this one and no luck. Looks bad, and I can't embed images! Or links!

Ideally, above it should be showing a header of sorts. I'll check back on that tomorrow, same with <b> some bold <i> and italisied(?)</i></b> text!

Actually, what would make more sense is to just use HTMX and have these blog posts be read and sent back via hx-get!

Watch this: 

<br>

<button hx-get="/api/this_wont_work">What is this now?</button>
